    "In this lab, we will set up a numerical experiment matching the physics problem of the Taylor-Sedov blast wave. A large amount of thermal energy is placed at the origin of a sphere of constant density gas. It then expands into the surrounding medium, producing a shock where the physical conditions are discontinuous between the ambient medium and the region the blast wave has passed through.\n",

We will determine whether the errors decrease with increasing number of numerical grid zones in the way expected for our numerical algorithm. This is often called a \"convergence study\" in astrophysics -- seeing whether and how quickly our numerical answer approaches the correct value from theory as the number of resolution elements goes to infinity."
